# inverted-pendulum

Physics simulation of a pendulum on a slider. Experimentally using svg driven by code for animation (runs way better in chrome than firefox) and using the classic Runge-Kutta method for integrating the equations of motion. You can also set PID values for a controller that aims to hold the pendulum upright.
